# Project CIBELE

The Cutting and Packing (C&P) Problems emerge in various manufacturing industries when a larger object needs to be divided into smaller parts, minimizing waste. Solving these problems in an optimized manner can reduce the cost of raw materials and, consequently, have a positive economic and environmental impact. However, many companies prefer simpler ways of cutting raw materials instead of using more complex and optimized cutting patterns, which can result in greater waste.

In the CIBELE project, the importance of explicitly considering the impact of the complexity of cutting patterns on raw material consumption is studied, as well as the use of multi-objective optimization techniques to deal with conflicting goals of minimizing waste and the overall production cost by controlling the complexity of cutting patterns, particularly their geometric complexity.
